<b> Lab | <b> Basic Electrical Science (Simulation)
<b> Experiment|     <b> To study and measurement of power factor of an electrical load.
<h5> About the Experiment : </h5> <br>

To understand how efficiently electrical power is converted into useful work output. In an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred.<br>
