<h5> About the Experiment : </h5> <br>

<b> To verify kirchhoff's voltage law.</b>

The Aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the voltage in their respective branches.<br>

 <b>Objectives:- </b><br>

1.To understand the Kirchhoff’s junction and loop in the electrical circuit.<br>
2.To measure voltage in a circuit for each element.<br>
3.To Verify Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law by comparing analytically calculated values with practical one.<br>
4.To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.

<b>To verify kirchhoff's current law.</b><br>

The Aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the current in their respective branches.  <br>
